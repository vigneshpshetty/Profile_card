I have created a profile card using React and JavaScript, demonstrating my understanding of React fundamentals. The profile card can be accessed through this live link: https://vignesh-profile-card.netlify.app/

To run the React app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
Install the dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
To deploy the React app, you can use Netlify by following these steps:

Sign up for a Netlify account at https://www.netlify.com/.
Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
Configure the deployment settings, specifying the build command as npm run build and the publish directory as build/.
Deploy the app to Netlify.
Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a live link for your app.
Feel free to modify the instructions based on your specific setup and preferences.
